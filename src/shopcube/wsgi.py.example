# The "/home/appinv" below specifies your home
# directory -- the rest should be the directory you uploaded your Flask
# code to underneath the home directory.  So if you just ran
# "git clone git@github.com/myusername/myproject.git"
# ...or uploaded files to the directory "myproject", then you should
# specify "/home/appinv/myproject"
# on shell do pwd to get a path like this:'/home2/folder/shopyo/shopyo' set path to this

#
# NB -- many Flask guides suggest you use a file called run.py; that's
# not necessary on PythonAnywhere.  And you should make sure your code
# does *not* invoke the flask development server with app.run(), as it
# will prevent your wsgi file from working.
